"""Piper text-to-speech deployment — the portable TTS engine.

Why this exists alongside CosyVoice3 (``text_to_speech.py``):

CosyVoice gives zero-shot voice cloning but needs torch plus a working
CUDA/ROCm stack, and on CPU it synthesises at roughly 7x *slower* than
realtime — unusable in a conversation. It also cannot run on consumer RDNA3
GPUs at all (the HiFi-GAN vocoder faults inside a MIOpen convolution), so on
an AMD machine there is no fast path.

Piper is ONNX-only: no torch, no GPU, a 61 MB voice model, and measured at
~0.03x realtime on a Ryzen 7840HS — about 30x faster than it speaks, with the
first chunk in ~30 ms. That makes it the engine that works on *any* machine,
which is why it is the default. CosyVoice stays selectable with
``HURI_TTS_ENGINE=cosyvoice`` when an NVIDIA GPU is present and the cloned
voice matters more than latency.

The public surface is deliberately identical to ``TTSDeployment`` —
``get_sample_rate`` / ``start_session`` / ``push_text`` / ``stream_audio`` — so
``TTS`` (the per-session module) and the generated Serve config work with
either engine unchanged. Both are registered as ``name="TTS"`` so a config's
``deployments: - name: TTS`` block matches whichever is bound.
